aopy - An Aspect Oriented Programming Python Framework 

Author - Spencer Herzberg
Author - Yuji Fujiki

This framework was built for a graduate software engineering course in Aspect Oriented Programming.

Requirements:

    Build a Python AOP framework that corresponds with AspectJ
    Joinpoint model
    Pointcut definitions are meant to be simple
    Advice: Before, After, Around
    Before and after advice are very simple methods
    Around advice is very flexible
    Dynamic runtime changes
    Security measures: define only methods that are "weave-able" 

Future Work:

    Build in regular expressions for more flexible and dynamic pointcuts
    Additional pointcuts for advice.
    Eclipse plugin for showing advised code blocks
